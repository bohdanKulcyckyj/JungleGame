## Idea

Singleplayer level-based 2D game, coded using raylib, with multiple endings based on choices during playthrough.

An employee of a wood processing company gets a difficult task - they have to travel to a rainforest and "cultivate" it for future logging. Equipped with a machete,
a gun and a lasso, the now confident company hero soon finds out not everything is what it seems to be at the first glance, or what they were told ..

Multiple types of entities:
  - mushrooms
  - indigenous people (both friendly and aggressive)
  - flowers
  - ...
  
Dangerous nature:
  - rocks
  - quicksand
  - mud
  - branches and trees
  - set traps (spikes under leaves on the floor etc.)
